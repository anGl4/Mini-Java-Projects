# Mini-Java-Projects
Repository with mini Java projects that I made in order to practice for OOP Exam.
Both projects are made using Swing.

Project in folder swingJpg opens all pictures with prefix ".jpg" from whichever folder you want and show them on screen.
Other project generates password based on requierments that you set yourself by clicking checkboxes and typing in length of password.
